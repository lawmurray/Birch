/**
 * @mainpage Birch Developer Reference
 *
 * Birch is a compiled, imperative, object-oriented, and probabilistic
 * programming language. The latter is its primary research concern.
 *
 * It consists of:
 *
 * @li the @c birch driver program, and
 * @li the @c libbirch.* compiler library and associated header files.
 *
 * This documentation relates to these components and is only of
 * interest to @em developers of the above; @em users will be more
 * interested in the standard library, documented separately.
 *
 * The @em Modules page is a good place to start.
