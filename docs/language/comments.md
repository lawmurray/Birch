## Comments

Comments in Birch are as per C++:

    // end-of-line comment
    /* block comment */

In the spirit of JavaDoc and Doxygen, block comments that begin with two stars denote special documentation comments that are extracted by the `birch doc` command:

    /** documentation comment */

These typically appear immediately prior to class and function declarations to document their behaviour.
